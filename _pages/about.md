I am an assistant professor of **Operations Management** at  <a href="https://sds.cuhk.edu.cn/" target="_blank"><span style="color:black">School of Data Science</span></a>, the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen.

### Research Interests
* I like research with real-wrold applications. Personally, I am trying to and desire to cooperate with industry. Specifially, I focus on:
  * Revenue management in recommendation systems (like live-streaming platforms)
  * Investment management in innovation market
  * Player matching in games (which I have no papers relevant to, but aim to focus on in the future)
  * Policy implications for government (for example carbon emission control) etc. 
* In order to outpt good application articles and convince the industry, I am learning and have grasped many methodologies, including:
  *  Mechanism design
  *  Dyanmic programming and stochastic optimization
  *  Complexity analysis, bandits and online algorithms. 
  *  Recently, I am also very interested in algorithmic game theory and privacy preserving algorithms. 
* I will devote half of my attention to empirical study in the future.
 
### To students: 
* If you have a strong **mathematical** background and are interested in visiting or working on a project with me, please drop me an email at pgao@connect.ust.hk.
* I already have three potential graduates with bachelor's degrees in mathematics, economics and business. I may not be able to support more students. Cooperations are always welcome and special opportunities always exist.
