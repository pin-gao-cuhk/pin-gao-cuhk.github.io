I will join the <a href="https://sds.cuhk.edu.cn/" target="_blank"><span style="color:black">School of Data Science at the Chinese University of Hong Kong (Shenzhen)</span></a> as an assistant professor in the summer of 2021.

My research is focused on revenue management, especially in recommendation systems. Various methodoligies I use include multi-armed bandits, online algorithms and mechanism design. Recently, I am very interested in algorithmic game theory, privacy preserving recommendations and causal inference.


I am looking for PhD students/postdocs/RA to work with me at CUHK-Shenzhen.  Students with a degree of bachelor/master/phd in math/physics/OR/... are welcome to contact me.  <a href="https://sds.cuhk.edu.cn/en/phd-programmes/applications" target="_blank"><span style="color:black">Application</span></a>, <a href="https://sds.cuhk.edu.cn/en/phd-programmes/scholarships" target="_blank"><span style="color:black">Scholarships</span></a>.
